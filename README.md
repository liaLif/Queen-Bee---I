# Queen Bee - I

In this project I have created a memory card game using vanilla JavaScript, Css and HTML.

The game consists of a game board for one player where 12 upside-down cards are arranged in a 4x3 layout.

When the player clicks a card, the card reveals a bee picture. When clicking on a second card, 

if the two cards show the same image they are removed from the board, 

while the other cards stay in their original position, and a "match found" is displayed to the console.

If the two cards are different they change back to be upside-down and a "not a match" is displayed to the console.

If the player clicks the same card twice, the card changes back to be upside-down and a "same card clicked" is displayed to the console.

The game board displays a seconds and moves count which stops when the board is cleared and a "Congratulations!"

message is displayed to the user before the game is reloaded. The cards are shuffled with every new game.

Using the setAttribute method I have designed it so every time an upside-down card is clicked its class changes from "back"

to "front" and vice versa.

All images seen in this project were designed and created by me and/or were downloaded from freeimages.com .
